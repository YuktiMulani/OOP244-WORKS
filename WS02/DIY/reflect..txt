This workshop has been very informative and knowledgeable for me as I have 
learned a lot of new concepts. One of them is how to define pure natural functions while 
running the program this can be done by introducing an interface class.implementing behaviors declared in a pure virtual function is another thing I learned from 
this workshop .the following things were important too.
explain the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class
this workshop got the best out of me cause I wanted to do it without taking anybody's help and I did it which 
made me feel confident and satisfied.
