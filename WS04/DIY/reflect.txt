This lab has been a little easier than the previous labs. In this lab, I learned 
the following topics:-
-Derive a class with resource from a base class which also includes a dynamic cString.
-Override virtual an non-virtual methods of the base class.
-Apply the rule of three to the base and the derived class
-Use the acquired skills throughout the semester to read and write dynamic data from int into date files.
 
Derived Class: A class that is created from an existing class which is called a base class. The derived
class inherits all members and member functions of a base class. The derived class can have more functionality 
with respect to the Base class and can easily access the Base class.
It took some effort to deal with the cstring in the base class but after taking a look at the notes and the 
lecture it was possible for me to do it.Another challenge was to override the non virtual function which was also 
achieved but with a little hardwork and concentration.
Overall this workshop has cleared all my concepts andhelped step out of my comfort zone.
