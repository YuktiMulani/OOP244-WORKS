This workshop helped me to get a stronger grip on the topics like:-
1.define and create binary member operators
2.define and create various type conversion operators
3.define and create unary operators
4.define and create helper binary operator between classes
5.define and create helper operators between a primitive type and a class.


I learned that a binary operation consists of one operator and two operands.  
In a binary member operator, the left operand is the current object and the 
member function takes one explicit parameter: the right operand. 

Type conversion operators define implicit conversions to different types, 
including fundamental types. The unary operator does not take any explicit 
parameters except for post fix operator. 
This workshop helped to revise all the topics and cleared the concepts needed for midterm too.
