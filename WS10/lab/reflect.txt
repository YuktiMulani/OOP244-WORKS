This workshop helped me to concentrate on the following topics.
-Code function templates
-Implement calls to function templates

Special functions that can interact with generic types are known 
as function templates. As a result, we can develop a function 
template whose functionality can be applied to multiple types or 
classes without having to duplicate the full code for each kind. 
This may be done by using template parameters.

Once a function template has been declared and defined, it can be 
called in other functions or templates (like the main() function) 
using the following syntax.

functionName<dataType>(parameter1, parameter2,...);

these helped me build the most important aspect of the code and 
was really helpful in completing the program.
