In this workshop, I learned to use methods to query the state of an object 
which is checking the status without changing the actual data.This 
was done in the draw function in which bars were drawn if they were valid 
without changing the data.

Talking about difficulties faced in this function I faced some difficulties 
in the add function where it was instructed to add the next bar to the bar chart.
I had difficulties understanding the logic needed for this function. Then I 
referred to the notes provided in the class and the online notes and finally figured it out.
